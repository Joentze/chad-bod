    "Can I still volunteer in other Community Service Projects after completing the 80-hour requirement? Of course! If you will like your additional hours to be reflected in your records, then please follow the procedures in the Community Service e-Guidebook on eLearn.",
    "What is the Community Service e-Briefing? Only for AY 18 & earlier cohorts: The e-Briefing is a mandatory briefing that all SMU students must pass before starting on their Community Service graduate requirement.",

You can continue to track your community service hours\u2019 update on OASIS > Self-Service Apps > Participation and Grading.",
    "Am I allowed to do an internship using tourist visa? Generally, you are not allowed to do an internship while on a tourist visa. Some countries allow such an arrangement and some do not. Hong Kong, for example, offers a Training Visa for internships. Hence, all internships in Hong Kong will require a visa unless the purpose is a short three- to seven-day business visit. Some countries do not require a visa for Singaporeans to work for 90 days or less. Please consult with the DKHMCC Overseas Desk before you commit to the overseas internship.",
    "Can I apply for an overseas internship while abroad? Yes, we understand that many students while abroad (e.g. on international exchange) may want to embark on an internship following the end of their exchange programme in the same or different country. Wonderful idea! However, prior to submission of an application, you must email the DKHMCC Overseas Desk to discuss an alternative interview arrangement (e.g. phone or Skype) with the prospective employer. Without prior arrangement, your application may be at a disadvantage. Remember to submit a self-proposal on OnTRAC II for the internship to count towards your graduation requirement.",
    "Do I need to buy travel insurance for overseas internship? Students embarking on an overseas internship must purchase adequate travel insurance before the internship commences. This includes international students going back to their home countries for internship. A medical insurance or group insurance provided by the host company is not the same as travel insurance. Therefore, you still need to buy a travel insurance even if the hiring company provides its interns with medical or group insurance. Please note that your preferred travel insurance policy must cover at least S$150,000 for life and S$250,000 for emergency evacuation.",
    "Do I need to know a foreign language to apply for overseas internships? There should be no language barrier if you intern in an English-speaking country. For other internships, especially those solicited by the DKHMCC Overseas Desk and offered via OnTRAC II, foreign language ability is usually not required, unless otherwise stated. Consult the DKHMCC Overseas Desk for the foreign language eligibility requirements if you plan to take up an internship overseas.",
    "Does going back to my own home country constitute overseas internship? All internships that take place outside Singapore are considered overseas internships. This is because you are considered an SMU student from Singapore regardless of your nationality.So if you go on exchange, and you return back to your home country, you may want to find or have found an internship there, it will still be considered overseas internship.So for these two types of overseas internships (11a: those which you found while on exchange or 11b: when you are back in your home countries), we envisage an issue concerning the travel insurance protection. This issue is critical because, without a travel insurance protection, your self-proposed internships will not be approved and recognized. We therefore strongly advise that these students consult the DKHMCC Overseas Desk prior to departure for exchange/home country.",
    "How do I apply for an overseas internship? The application procedure for overseas internships is the same as that for local internships in Singapore.",
    "How do I know which country the overseas internship position is located in? Overseas internship positions posted on OnTRAC II are often identified by the city name in brackets, e.g., Market Intern (Shanghai), Finance Intern (Hong Kong), IS Intern (Bangalore), etc.",
    "How long are the overseas internships? The actual duration of the overseas internships varies across countries, companies and internships. For example, most summer internships in mainland China and Hong Kong are three months in duration, typically during the summer from May to July. In fact, many Chinese employers prefer longer internships of up to six months. On the other hand, most summer internships in India and the Middle East usually last for 10 to 12 weeks.",
    "How many days/hours a week will I work when on internship? Interns must abide by the staff and work policies of their host companies. The work week of most internships is five days, and/or up to 40 hours per week. The actual work week may vary across companies, involving over-time work as well.",
    "How much is the cost of interning in an overseas country? There is no blanket answer as it depends on the length of the overseas internship, the country, and the city. For example, the housing costs vary tremendously between Hong Kong and Chongqing. Overall, it is a good idea that you budget about S$5,000 to S$6,000 in order to intern and live comfortably for a three-month long summer in an overseas country, or more if the internship is longer and in an \u2018expensive\u2019 country.",
    "I am a Student Pass Holder. Can I apply for overseas internships? Yes, in-principle. However, many countries do not grant foreigners (i.e. non-Singapore citizens) a visa for internship purposes through their embassies in Singapore. These students should consult with the DKHMCC Overseas Desk if this restriction applies to them.",
    "If I am an international student going back to my home country for internship, do I need to buy insurance? Travel insurance is compulsory for all students when embarking on a recognised overseas internship, regardless of whether the country they are interning in is their home country or not. Failure to purchase (and show proof of) travel insurance before you depart Singapore will render your internship void. A medical insurance or group insurance provided by the host company is not the same as travel insurance. Therefore, you are still required to buy travel insurance even if the hiring company provides its interns with medical or group insurance. Please note that your preferred travel insurance policy must cover at least S$150,000 for life and S$250,000 for emergency evacuation.",
    "What should I do before applying for an overseas internship? We advise that you take the following steps prior to the application: - Consult the DKHMCC Overseas Desk (by appointment), especially if you have questions or concerns about working and living in an overseas country. - Seek parental consent, especially if you need their financial support. - Pass the e-internship briefing requirement and also attend the overseas internship information session.",
    "When are the overseas internships posted on OnTRAC II ? For summer internships, most internship openings are posted on OnTRAC II from January to March. For semester internships, such openings are usually posted on OnTRAC II about two-three months before the commencement of the next semester. Students who plan to go overseas for internships are strongly advised to seek consultation with the DKHMCC Overseas Desk to discuss their country interests, internship needs, preparations (e.g., budget), and for some, their readiness, as early as possible. The DKHMCC Overseas Desk may have some internship positions to recommend to you, often resulting in your direct placement to the company/country.",
    "When do overseas internships start? For summer internships, the actual start date of the overseas internships varies across countries, companies and internships. For example, most summer internships in mainland China and Hong Kong typicsally start in the first week of May, immediately after the Labour Day holiday. For India and the Middle East, most summer internships often start in the first week of June. For term-time internship in Term 1, the actual start date usually starts in early December or immediately after the New Year in January. For term-time internships in Term 2, the start date is usually sometime in June. The start dates of all overseas postings are stated on OnTRAC II.",
    "Which countries will the overseas interns be posted to? In line with SMU and the Singapore Government strategies of internationalization and regionalization, DKHMCC Overseas Desk has put the focus on the emerging markets in the Greater China, India, the Middle East, and the ASEAN regions. However, we do encourage and support overseas internships in any country of the world.Note that the overseas internship positions posted on OnTRAC II are often identified by the city name in brackets, e.g., Market Intern (Shanghai), Finance Intern (Hong Kong), IS Intern (Bangalore), etc",

    "Why do I need to buy travel insurance for an overseas intership? This prerequisite is critical because without travel insurance protection, your self-proposed internship will not be approved and recognised.",
    "Will I be paid for an overseas internship? Most overseas internships are paid but the amount varies depending on many factors: legal requirements, local \u2018internship culture\u2019 and the \u2018norm\u2019 of pay for local and overseas interns. For example, in China and Mexico, it is illegal for companies to pay a salary to a foreign intern as he is not legally hired as an expatriate employee. In Hong Kong, an internship is widely accepted as company-supported training and both students and universities do not ask for a salary. However, most companies do provide a modest stipend (like an allowance for transport and meal) in local currency (e.g., RMB1,500 per month in Shanghai, HK$2,000 per month in Hong Kong and Rs 5000 per month in Bangalore) to help you defray transportation and food expenses. You can check out the actual amount of stipend, if any, in the Job Description posted on OnTRAC II.",
    "Will I meet my employer before starting the overseas internship? Most companies interview their prospective interns via phone, Skype or sometimes on-site in the Singapore Office or even in DKHMCC. The interview is an ideal platform for you to enquire further details on the role or work environment . However, you may not meet the supervisor or manager prior to your first day of work at the company in the overseas country.",
    "Will I receive any financial grant or subsidy for overseas internships? The International Enterprise (IE) Singapore operates a Young Talents Programme (YTP). Co-funded by IE and SMU, the YTP scheme provides financial subsidy to help you partially defray living expenses. For some countries, the scheme covers up to 75% of the airfare. YTP is applicable to Singaporean citizens and permanent residents only, and is subject to terms and conditions. Consult the Overseas Desk of DKHMCC for more details about the YTP.",
