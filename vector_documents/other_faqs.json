    "Why is SMU making it a requirement for all undergraduates to acquire overseas experience during their period of study at the University? Global traction and understanding underpins success in careers in today\u2019s globally connected environment. \u00a0To have global exposure from the vantage of a university education is invaluable for international networking and global vision; it also open doors to bigger opportunities.When students approach their global exposure opportunities with an enthusiastic and open mind, the benefits are immense.\u00a0 Academically, gaining a first-hand, real-world perspective of issues learnt in the classroom serves to deepen students\u2019 learning and knowledge application.\u00a0 More importantly, the journey builds independence, empathy, open-mindedness, not to mention soft-skills like communication and teamwork.\u00a0 These attributes not only build character and personal development, but also give students an edge when they are seeking employment and advancement in the competitive workplace.We believe that our consistently strongGraduate Employment Surveyresults can be attributed to SMU\u2019s holistic approach towards education (which includes making 80-hours of community service and 10-week of internship graduation requirements), and particularly to the international exposure that the majority of SMU graduates receive.\u00a0 To make sure no student misses out on this precious global experience, the University is committed to giving global exposure participation an extra push by enhancing support and by providing more (and new) opportunities for students.",
